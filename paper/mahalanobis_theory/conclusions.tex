\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper establishes a novel connection between neural network architectures and the Mahalanobis distance, providing a fresh perspective on neural network interpretability. By demonstrating how linear layers with Abs activations can approximate Mahalanobis distances, we bridge the gap between statistical distance measures and neural network operations. This framework offers several key insights:

\begin{itemize}
    \item It provides a probabilistic interpretation of neural network nodes as learning principal components of Gaussian distributions.
    \item It suggests new approaches for model initialization, pretraining, and componentization.
    \item It establishes a potential homomorphism between neural networks and hierarchical Gaussian Mixture Models.
\end{itemize}

These findings lay the groundwork for future research into more interpretable and robust neural network architectures. By leveraging statistical principles in neural network design, we open new avenues for enhancing model transparency, improving generalization, and developing more efficient training techniques. As the field of AI continues to evolve, such interpretable frameworks will be crucial in building trustworthy and explainable AI systems.
