\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:future_work}

The mathematical framework established in this paper lays a solid foundation for interpreting neural networks through the lens of Mahalanobis distance. However, several avenues remain unexplored that can further enhance our understanding and application of this framework. This section outlines potential directions for future research, aimed at extending the theoretical connections, improving practical implementations, and broadening the applicability of our approach.

\subsection{Extension to Deep and Complex Architectures}

While this study primarily focuses on shallow neural networks, extending the framework to deeper and more complex architectures presents a significant opportunity. Future research can investigate how convolutional layers, recurrent networks, and transformer architectures can incorporate distance-based interpretations. Specifically:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)}: Explore how convolutional filters can be aligned with principal components in spatial data, facilitating distance-based feature extraction in image and video processing tasks.
    \item \textbf{Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)}: Analyze how recurrent connections in RNNs can capture temporal dependencies through distance metrics, enhancing interpretability in sequence modeling applications.
    \item \textbf{Transformer Architectures}: Investigate the role of attention mechanisms in approximating distance-based relationships within transformer models, potentially improving the interpretability of self-attention layers.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Development of Novel Activation Functions}

The Abs and ReLU activation functions have been instrumental in approximating distance metrics, yet there is room for innovation in designing activation functions tailored specifically for distance-based interpretations. Future work can focus on:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Symmetric Activation Functions}: Develop activation functions that inherently capture both positive and negative deviations without requiring paired units, enhancing computational efficiency and interpretability.
    \item \textbf{Adaptive Activation Functions}: Create adaptive activations that dynamically adjust their behavior based on the data distribution, potentially improving the approximation of complex distance metrics.
    \item \textbf{Hybrid Activations}: Combine the strengths of Abs and ReLU to form hybrid activation functions that balance symmetry, sparsity, and computational efficiency.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Comprehensive Empirical Validation}

To substantiate the theoretical claims and assess the practical utility of the proposed framework, extensive empirical studies are necessary. Future research should:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Diverse Datasets}: Validate the framework across a wide range of datasets, including those with non-Gaussian distributions, high dimensionality, and varying levels of noise.
    \item \textbf{Benchmarking Against Traditional Models}: Compare the performance and interpretability of distance-based neural networks with traditional activation functions and nearest neighbor algorithms on standard benchmarks.
    \item \textbf{Real-World Applications}: Apply the framework to real-world tasks such as anomaly detection, image classification, and natural language processing to evaluate its effectiveness and practicality.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Integration with Probabilistic Models}

Integrating the distance-based framework with probabilistic models can enhance the interpretability and robustness of neural networks. Future endeavors can explore:
\begin{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Generative Models}: Extend the framework to generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs), leveraging distance metrics to enhance the quality and interpretability of generated data.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Optimization of Initialization Strategies}

Initialization plays a crucial role in guiding neural networks towards meaningful solutions. Building on the insights from bias initialization:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data-Driven Initialization}: Develop initialization strategies that leverage data-driven insights, such as initializing weights based on principal components or other statistical measures derived from the training data.
    \item \textbf{Adaptive Initialization}: Create adaptive initialization methods that adjust initial weights and biases dynamically during the early stages of training to promote alignment with distance-based interpretations.
    \item \textbf{Impact on Convergence}: Study the impact of various initialization strategies on the convergence behavior and stability of distance-based neural networks.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scalability and Computational Efficiency}

Ensuring that the distance-based framework scales effectively to large-scale neural networks and high-dimensional data is essential for practical applications. Future research should address:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Efficient Computations}: Optimize the computational aspects of distance approximations, potentially through parallelization or approximation techniques, to reduce overhead in large networks.
    \item \textbf{Memory Management}: Investigate memory-efficient implementations of distance-based activations and layer configurations to facilitate deployment in resource-constrained environments.
    \item \textbf{Hardware Acceleration}: Explore the use of specialized hardware accelerators, such as GPUs and TPUs, to enhance the performance of distance-based neural networks.
\end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Robust Distance Metrics}: Explore the integration of robust distance metrics that are less sensitive to outliers and noise, enhancing the reliability of neural network interpretations.
    \item \textbf{Theoretical Guarantees}: Provide formal theoretical guarantees regarding the approximation accuracy of distance metrics by neural network activations under various conditions.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User-Friendly Tools and Frameworks}

To facilitate the adoption and further exploration of the distance-based framework, developing user-friendly tools and software frameworks is essential:
