    This paper establishes a novel connection between neural network architectures and the 
    Mahalanobis distance, a statistical measure accounting for data covariance structure. 
    We provide a robust mathematical framework bridging neural networks with this 
    statistical distance measure, demonstrating how Absolute Value (Abs) activations 
    facilitate distance-based interpretations. This distance-based 
    interpretation has the potential to enhance model robustness, improve generalization, 
    and provide more intuitive explanations of neural network decisions.
