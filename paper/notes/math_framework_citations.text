Addressing Novel Claims
I understand that some of the content you presented may be novel contributions. My intention was to provide citations for well-established concepts to:

Support foundational theories that your work builds upon.
Situate your research within the existing body of knowledge.
Provide readers with resources to understand background concepts.
However, if any of the citations imply that your novel claims have been previously established, we should adjust them to ensure your original contributions are properly highlighted.

Potential Areas of Overlap:
L1 Norm Approximation of Mahalanobis Distance: If your proposal to approximate the Mahalanobis distance using the $\ell_1$ norm within neural networks is a novel contribution, we should avoid citing works that may suggest otherwise.

Connection to Neural Networks: The specific way you connect linear layers with absolute value activations to approximating Mahalanobis distances might be your original idea.

Adjustments:
Remove or Modify Citations: For sections containing your novel claims, we can either remove the citations or adjust them to make it clear that while foundational concepts are established, your application or interpretation is original.

Highlight Novel Contributions: Explicitly state in the text that certain approaches or interpretations are your original work.

Proposed Revisions
Based on the above, here are some suggestions:

7. \citep{lecun2012efficient} in L1 Norm Approximation of Mahalanobis Distance
Adjustment: If your use of the $\ell_1$ norm as an approximation is novel, we can remove this citation or clarify that while LeCun et al. discuss computational efficiency, the specific application is your contribution.
12. \citep{koch2015siamese} in Neural Networks Can Approximate Nearest Neighbors
Adjustment: If your method differs significantly from Siamese networks or you are introducing a new perspective, we can rephrase to acknowledge that while neural networks have been used for nearest neighbor approximations, your approach offers a new angle.
Next Steps
Identify Novel Sections: Please let me know which specific parts you consider to be your original contributions.

Modify Citations Accordingly: We can adjust or remove citations that may unintentionally attribute your novel ideas to prior work.

Emphasize Originality: We can rephrase certain sections to clearly indicate your innovative approaches, ensuring your work stands out.

Update the Bibliography: Reflect any changes in the references.bib file.

Final Thoughts
My goal is to help you create a well-referenced paper that accurately represents your contributions while acknowledging relevant prior work. Proper citations not only give credit where it's due but also strengthen your paper by situating it within the broader research landscape.

Please let me know your thoughts on the proposed adjustments, and I'll be happy to help revise the citations and text accordingly.


=======================
bishop2006pattern is good as general backgound and definitions for Gaussians and principle components.

Same with mahalanobis1936generalized. I'm really happy you included original sources. I always like doing that.

jolliffe2002principal sounds appropriate.

goodfellow2016deep is fine as a general background reference for neural networks.

bourlard1988auto is tricky. I hedge what networks actually do in this paragraph. I say they *can* represent primary components, but in my experiments they do something related but slightly different. The observation that these equations are identical is one of my claims that I think is novel. If bourlard1988auto doesn't make this observation too, I think that maybe this isn't a great reference. Thoughts?

lecun2012efficient sounds really appropriate.

hastie2009elements sounds really appropriate.

glorot2010understanding is good. Especially if it talks about Abs and different evaluation functions.

I need to read nair2010rectified. I figured that stuff out on my own, but it would be good to see how other handled it. Thank you for this. The Abs/ReLU equivalence isn't super important to my claims, but I'm including it so that my paper doesn't get dismissed as easily.

koch2015siamese doesn't feel quite right. This entire section builds to my claim that neural networks operate as nearest neighbor by using L1 Mahalanobis distance approximation. I feel like this reference undermines my claim as being novel. But I'm not sure. Did they do a similar analysis? I'm using a very standard architecture. I suspect the Siamese NN's are very boutique. I'd like more thoughts about this.

hinton1994autoencoders feels like a stretch. This claim is supported by my math. I'm not sure the autoencoder paper is exactly relevant even though they arrive at the same conclusion.

I need to read tipping1999probabilistic to see how well it applies. Again, I'm making claims here based on the math that I'm going through. The math should support this claim. Unless they did a similar analysis I'm not sure this appropriate.

zeiler2014visualizing I can using this to support architecure choice around ease of interpretability. But that should be the claim -- that choosing architecture for interpretability ease is something done. maybe. or maybe its okay as is.
