\section{Experiment 3: Application to LeNet on MNIST}
\label{sec:experiment3}

TBD: This experiment trains LeNet on MNIST using ReLU and Abs and compares performance.

\subsection{Modifying LeNet Architecture}

We adapted the LeNet architecture by replacing traditional activation functions with absolute value activations.

% Describe the modifications and rationale.

\subsection{Training and Evaluation}

% Present the training procedure and results, comparing the modified LeNet with the standard version.
