\section{Interpretation of Learned Features}
\label{sec:interpretation}

TBD: This section uses the models trained the the previous experiment, interprets the linear nodes as Gaussian and finds the mean value. These are compared to the means used to build the kMeans NN model.

\subsection{Extracting Expected Values}

We calculated the expected value (mean) for each node's corresponding 1D Gaussian to interpret the learned features.

% Discuss the methodology and findings.

\subsection{Visualization}

% Include figures and explanations of the learned features, highlighting how they correspond to cluster centers.
