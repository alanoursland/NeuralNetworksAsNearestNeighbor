\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}
TBD: Discussion of experimental results.


\subsection{The Nearest Neighbor Interpretation}

Our experiments support the interpretation of neural networks as nearest neighbor models. The use of absolute value activations allows linear layers to approximate Mahalanobis distances effectively.

% Expand on the implications for interpretability and understanding of neural networks.

\subsection{Advantages and Limitations}

% Discuss the benefits and potential challenges of the proposed approach.

\subsection{Connections to Batch Normalization}

While not the focus of this paper, there is a connection between our Gaussian interpretation and batch normalization techniques, suggesting avenues for future research.

% Briefly mention this connection and possible future work.
