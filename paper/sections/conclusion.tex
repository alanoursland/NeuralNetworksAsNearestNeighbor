\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we introduced a new perspective on neural networks by interpreting them as nearest neighbor models. Through mathematical derivations and empirical experiments, we demonstrated how linear layers with absolute value activations approximate Mahalanobis distances to cluster centers.

Our findings offer valuable insights into neural network interpretability and suggest potential for improved initialization strategies and feature learning. Future work will explore deeper theoretical connections and applications to more complex architectures and datasets.
